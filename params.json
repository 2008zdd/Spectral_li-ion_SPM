  "body": "About _Spectral li-ion SPM_\r\n===========================\r\n\r\n_Spectral li-ion SPM_ is a MATLAB code that solves the so-called \r\nlithium-ion battery Single Particle Model (SPM) using spectral numerical \r\nmethods.\r\nThe SPM is an electrochemical model describing lithium transport, reaction \r\nkinetics and thermodynamics in lithium-ion batteries. \r\n_Spectral li-ion SPM_ consists of the SPM coupled to a bulk thermal model \r\ndescribing the evolution of battery temperature. \r\nThe SPM is an approximation to the electrochemical pseudo-two dimensional \r\nlithium-ion battery model where electrolyte transport limitations are \r\nneglected. \r\nTherefore the SPM is only valid for relatively low currents, up to 1C or 2C \r\ndepending on the battery design.\r\nThe diffusion partial-differential equations of the SPM are discretised in \r\nspace using an efficient spectral numerical method: Chebyshev orthogonal \r\ncollocation. \r\nThis implementation of the SPM is similar to our implementation of the more \r\ncomplex pseudo-two dimensional battery model which is discussed in our \r\npaper:\r\n\r\nBizeray A.M., Zhao S., Duncan S. R., and Howey D. A., \r\n“Lithium-ion battery thermal-electrochemical model-based state \r\nestimation using orthogonal collocation and a modified extended Kalman \r\nfilter”, Journal of Power Sources, vol. 296, pp. 400-412, 2015. \r\n[Publisher copy][6] and [Open access pre-print][7].\r\n\r\nIf you use _Spectral li-ion SPM_ in your work, please cite our paper.\r\nThis code has been developed at the Department of Engineering Science of \r\nthe University of Oxford. \r\nFor information about our lithium-ion battery research, \r\nvisit the [Howey Research Group][2] website.\r\nIf you are interested in our energy research, \r\ncheck out our research group website [Energy and Power Group][1]. \r\n\r\nFor more information and comments, please contact \r\n[david.howey@eng.ox.ac.uk][5].\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n============\r\nYou will need MATLAB to run this code. This code has been developed and \r\ntested in MATLAB R2015b and should work with later versions. \r\nAlthough it has not been tested with earlier MATLAB releases, it should \r\nalso work with no or minor modifications.\r\n\r\nYou will also need the [_MATLAB Differentiation Matrix Suite_][4] developed \r\nby Weideman and Reddy to use our code (see \"Installation\"). The _MATLAB \r\nDifferentiation Matrix Suite_ is available for free on the \r\n[MathWorks website][3] and is used to compute the Chebyshev orthogonal \r\ncollocation differentiation matrices.\r\nMore details can be found on their [website][4] and [paper][10]: \r\nJAC Weideman, SC Reddy, A MATLAB differentiation matrix suite, \r\nACM Transactions of Mathematical Software, \r\nVol 26, pp 465-519 (2000).\r\n \r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n## Step 1 - Installing _Spectral li-ion SPM_ ##\r\n###Option 1 - Downloading a .zip file###\r\nDownload a .zip file of the code at:\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/adrienBizeray/Spectral_li-ion_SPM/archive/master.zip][8]\r\n\r\nThen, unzip the folder in a chosen directory on your computer.\r\n\r\n###Option 2 - Cloning the repository with Git###\r\nTo clone the repository, you will first need to have [Git][9] installed on \r\nyour computer. Then, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the \r\nrepository in a terminal, and type:\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/adrienBizeray/Spectral_li-ion_SPM.git\r\n```\r\nThe folder containing all the files should appear in your chosen directory.\r\n\r\n## Step 2 - Installing the _MATLAB Differentiation Matrix Suite_ ##\r\n1. Go to the MathWorks website at \r\nhttp://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29-dmsuite \r\nand download the `DMSUITE` folder \r\n(you may need to register and obtain a Mathworks account,\r\nalternatively you can download the `chebdif.m` file only [here][4]).\r\n\r\n2. Unzip the `DMSUITE` folder and put it somewhere on your MATLAB path. \r\nWe suggest to drop it in the `source` sub-folder of the \r\n_Spectral li-ion SPM_ code and run the following command to add this \r\nsub-folder to the MATLAB path:\r\n```\r\naddpath(genpath('source'));\r\n```\r\n\r\nGetting started\r\n===============\r\nThe best way to get started with _Spectral li-ion SPM_ is to have a look at\r\nthe [EXAMPLE_constant_current_discharge.m](EXAMPLE_constant_current_discharge.m) file. \r\nThis file runs a 1C constant-current discharge simulation for a LCO \r\nlithium-ion cell, and also gives some explanation about the single particle\r\nmodel and its MATLAB implementation using Chebyshev orthogonal collocation.\r\n\r\nThe [EXAMPLE_constant_current_discharge.m](EXAMPLE_constant_current_discharge.m) \r\nscript was written with MATLAB Publish markups, therefore the best way to \r\nread this file is to generate a HTML file by using the **MATLAB Publish** \r\nfunction instead of simply running the file (this may take a few minutes \r\nthe first time as pictures will be automatically generated).\r\nAlternatively, a PDF version of the file is available in the \r\n_Spectral li-ion SPM_ folder.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThis open-source MATLAB code is published under the BSD 3-clause License,\r\nplease read the `LICENSE.txt` file for more information.\r\n\r\n[1]: http://epg.eng.ox.ac.uk/\r\n[2]: http://users.ox.ac.uk/~engs1053/\r\n[3]: http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29-dmsuite\r\n[4]: http://dip.sun.ac.za/~weideman/research/differ.html\r\n[5]: mailto:david.howey@eng.ox.ac.uk\r\n[6]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775315300677\r\n[7]: http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08689\r\n[8]: https://github.com/adrienBizeray/Spectral_li-ion_SPM/archive/master.zip\r\n[9]: https://git-scm.com/\r\n[10]:http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=365727",
